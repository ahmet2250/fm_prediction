Football Player Value Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

It is the code for my graduate thesis called "Football Player Value Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques". It is a project which aims to predict market value of football players, which is scraped from transfermarkt.com, using Football Manager game attributes as features using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset has been created manually, and all the implementations are made in R.
