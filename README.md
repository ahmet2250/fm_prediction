# Football Player Value Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

It is the code for my graduate thesis called "Football Player Value Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques". It is a project which aims to predict market value of football players, which is scraped from transfermarkt.com, using Football Manager game attributes as features using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset has been created manually, and all the implementations are made in R.  

# Repository
In the repository, "model_script_final.R" file is the main script for building all linear regression, decision tree and neural network models using "Player.xlsx" data. "Player19.xlsx" dataset has been used as a test set for the models for evaluation of the models and reporting purposes. The original study has been conducted with an unknown version of R and related  packages; therefore, the original results are not fully reproducible but close results are obtained.
